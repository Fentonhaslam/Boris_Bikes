# Boris_Bikes
Brief:
Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

Role of this challenge is to establish a program using user stories, create feature tests from domain models and unit tests to create the overriding program.
